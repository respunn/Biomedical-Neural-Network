- The DenseNet model stood out as a balanced and high-performing model with a 70% accuracy rate. The training and validation accuracies were close, the losses decreased over time, and it was observed that the model had good generalization ability.

- The ResNet model achieved high accuracy on the training set but showed performance drops on the validation set. The gap between training and validation accuracies revealed signs of overfitting, indicating limited generalization ability.

- The Xception model demonstrated strong validation performance and generalization ability, with a 75% accuracy rate, similar to DenseNet. The small differences between training and validation accuracies, along with decreasing losses, supported the model's successful performance.

- The VGG16 and VGG19 models showed low performance with 50% accuracy on both training and validation sets. The stable accuracy and low, consistent loss levels indicated issues in the learning process.

- The Inception model performed well on the training set with a 95% accuracy rate but showed signs of overfitting on the validation set. The gap between training and validation accuracies and the high validation losses suggested the need for improving the model's generalization ability.

- The MobileNetV2 model performed well on the training set but poorly on the validation set, exhibiting signs of overfitting. This indicated that the model had limited generalization ability.

- The EfficientNetB0 model showed poor performance on both the training and validation sets. The consistently low accuracies and fixed loss values indicated that the model was ineffective in the classification task.

- The NASNetMobile model performed well on the training set but poorly on the validation set. The large gap between training and validation accuracies revealed signs of overfitting and limited generalization ability.

- The InceptionResNetV2 model achieved high performance on the training set but showed poor performance on the validation set. The gap between training and validation accuracies indicated signs of overfitting and the need for improving the model's generalization ability.
